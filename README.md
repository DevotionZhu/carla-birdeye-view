### Features
- **one-hot 3D feature map** (8x2D layers, each representing other entities, e.g. road layer, pedestrians layer) - made specifically to feed your CNN
- road and lane layers caching mechanism
- feature map **can be converted to an RGB** image
- uses **OpenCV rendering** (efficient, multi-threading friendly) instead of slow Pygame method
- huge **FPS speedup** thanks to restricted rendering (only agent's surroundings, not whole map)
- all CARLA maps are supported out-of-the-box, custom maps with valid OpenDrive file made in RoadRunner are also supported
- current implementation is specifically  adjusted for highway scenarios (prolonged shape), but other shapes and crops are easy to implement 

### Installation
```bash
pip install carla-birdview
```

### How to run

Make sure that PYTHONPATH env variable contains CARLA dist egg
```bash
# Launch server instance
./CarlaUE4.sh

# Preview while cruising on autopilot
python -m birdview
```
